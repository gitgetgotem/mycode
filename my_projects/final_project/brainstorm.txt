"""Around the World with API's"""

1. Vacation planner: taking input from the user to pull information from the web about different destinations (hotels, resteraunts etc.), using a public API

The main function of this will be taking the users input, after asking them what they like to do, what kind of weather they like, food, language, etc., and then asking them which things they value most in a vacation destination in order to "rank" different itineraries/locations. i.e., they may want warm weather, beaches, and certain cuisine, but maybe it being an english speaking country is a dealbreaker, so sifting through various api data in order to give a comprehensive vacation destination, with some suggestions on things to do there.
